# NHibernate MySQL MiniProfiler driver
The [MiniProfiler](http://miniprofiler.com/) library allows you to easily profile your application. It also has support for detecting queries that have run, but by default it only hooks in directly to Entity Framework or ADO.NET, not to NHibernate. This project shows how to allow allow MiniProfiler to also integrate with NHibernate. The project includes a client driver for MySQL, but it is easy to modify this code to support any client NHibernate supports.
